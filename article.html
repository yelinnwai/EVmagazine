        <p>
          If you want to live a more green-conscious lifestyle (including less trips to the gas station), an electric car is a great choice. Whether you're looking for sleek luxury, a practical SUV, or a compact car for daily driving, you can find an electric car that fits the bill.

          If you're interested in an electric vehicle (EV) and you want to learn more, you're in the right place. Here's what you need to know about buying an electric car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you need a compact SUV for trips around town, or are you looking for something to drive to work in style? Take time to consider the type of vehicle that will check all your must-have boxes.

          For example, if you're looking for a smart, high-tech sedan, a Tesla Model S from any year is a great choice. If you're seeking something with a bit more utility, the 2019-2020 Hyundai Kona EV is a crossover SUV with seating for up to five and plenty of cargo space (19.2 cu-ft behind the second row of seats).

          When switching to alternative fuel, it's worth thinking about how you drive—but range anxiety isn't the big deal that some people make it out to be. You'll be pleasantly surprised at the range of some of the newer used EVs. For example, the 2020 Tesla Model S Long Range gets an EPA-estimated 402 miles on a full charge.†
          If you look at your driving over a week, it's likely that kind of range is more than enough.

         To see for yourself, take some time to log your regular trips. What's your average mileage over a week or month? Some people shy away from electric vehicles based on the one long-distance trip they do every year, rather than looking at their normal driving habits. If you're traveling across the country to see family, you will have to stop and charge, but probably not as much as you think.

         Consider this: the 2020 gas-powered Nissan Sentra gets an EPA-estimated 33 mpg combined, which gives you an estimated 409 miles to a full tank.2 This is comparable with the 2020 Long Range Tesla Model S and its EPA-estimated 402-mile range (when fully charged).†
         Another thing to bear in mind is that an electric vehicle's range is more variable than the miles you'd get from a full tank of gas. Think of an electric car as a mobile phone—the more you do with it, the quicker the battery drops. EPA estimates of electric range tend to be fairly accurate, but it's worth knowing how you can maximize your range, as well as what will deplete the battery more quickly.
        </p>

          Typically, the faster you go, the more battery power you'll use. The same is true if you accelerate hard (just as your mpg might drop in a gas-powered vehicle if you have a heavy foot). If you want to conserve battery power, accelerate gently and make use of any regenerative braking features the vehicle might have. Regenerative braking, found on most electric cars, purposely slows the motor to generate a little charge back to the battery. This means that when you brake or, in some cases, lift off the gas pedal, the car will slow down and give you a mile or two back.

          The driving experience with an EV is typically smooth and simple. With no gears to climb through or revs to manage, it's easy to put down the power. The cabin of an EV is quiet, too, with no engine noise to disrupt the enjoyment of time spent with your passengers or a great sound system.

          Taking country roads instead of the highway is also a great choice if you're not in a rush. There's something really satisfying about taking the path less traveled during an electric journey. Plus, you can conserve a little battery power compared to driving at speed on bigger roads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another great feature of electric cars is instant torque. In other words, you always have maximum power available to you when you put your foot down. This makes winding through city traffic or passing on the highway a breeze, and it can make even the most unassuming electric car a lot of fun, too.

          Tesla is known for incredible zero-to-60 times, with the base 2020 Model S able to zoom from zero to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds, while the Performance model can do it in 2.3 seconds (according to the manufacturer, when new). These figures rival most sports cars. And, even smaller EVs have impressive zero-to-60 times. The 2020 all-electric Chevrolet Bolt EV, for example, will get to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds (according to the manufacturer, when new).
